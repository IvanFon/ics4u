## Using CMake with Code::Blocks

1. Run CMake with the generator set to Code::Blocks:

- Linux: `cmake -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles" <dir>`
- Windows: `cmake -G "CodeBlocks - MinGW Makefiles" <dir>`

2. Open the `.cbp` file that was created in Code::Blocks.
3. In Code::Blocks, select the target with the same name as the CMake target you want to build.
